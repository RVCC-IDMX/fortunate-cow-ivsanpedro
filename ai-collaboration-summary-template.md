## Key interaction

Document one meaningful interaction where you learned something or had to adjust your approach.

**My prompt:**

> How come the eyes aren't changing

**What happened:**

Agent suggested that the issue was that the pig creature doesn't support custom eyes. I changed the creature to a sheep, so I had the ability to change the eyes based on the time of day.

## Context engineering

**What effect did you observe from changing the instruction(s) to `copilot-instructions.md?**

Yes, Copilot followed my instructions. I noticed that it broke down its actions and explained the significance of each action.

## Reflection

Answer these questions thoughtfully. A few sentences each is fine.

**What stretched you?**

Customizing the creature stretched me because I used if/else to change the creature's eyes depending on the time of day, and I needed to be able to use variables and semicolons properly, as well as changing the eyes accordingly. 

**What did you learn?**

I learned that a number of cowsay creatures have the custom eyes feature. Also, I learned to save each time I made a change to fortune.js. I spent way too much time wondering why the changes I made were not reflected in the terminal.
